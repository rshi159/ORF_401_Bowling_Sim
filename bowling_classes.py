# set up the classes for bowling pin and bowling ball.

# Used by run_bowling_sim.py
# Please overwrite the calc_collisions function. It currently does some jank wizardry with uniform random variables. Also the bowling_ball class and bowling pin_class share a bunch of parameters and methods. May be able to create some sort of abstract class and inherit from it, if python allows it.
# also, we are doing dumb stuff here with linear and angular velocities. We assume that all collisions (generated in calc_collision) result in changes solely in linear velocity. When we update the linear velocity of an object, we subtract a random fraction of the energy and convert it to random rotation in 2 directions, split by a uniform random fraction.


# =====Big List of Assumptions We Make===========
# Assume that the center of mass of bowling pins stay in 2 dimensions.
# Assume that mass of bowling ball is uniformly distributed
# Assume all collisions are perfectly elastic
# Assume that bowling pins phase through everything between time steps and 
#   angle and velocity are updated linearly during those time steps
# Assume that upon collision between pins, kinetic energy is randomly distributed between
#   pins by a uniform distribution. Linear and rotational energies are split randomly by uniform distribution. Rotational components are split by uniform distribution between phi and theta.
# Assume that upon collision between a bowling ball and a pin, up to 50% of the ball's kinetic energy is transferred to the pin, with a random uniform distribution.
# Assume that the bowling ball has not rotation, but can instead follow a curved path.
# Assumethat bowling pins do not spin about their major axis.
# Assume that there is no friction/negligible
# Assume that the lane is flat.
# Assume gutter balls can be neglected
